# TODO's

**[In-Progress] Include Jonas's visualizations**

**[Backlog] Generate an AI-assisted visualization**

At least one graph has to be AI-generated

**[Backlog] Restructure the dashboard**

The *storytelling* element in the dashboard is lacking and does not tell a coherent story that supports our problem statement. We need to restructure the dashboard to have a better flow between storytelling elements and the graphs.
